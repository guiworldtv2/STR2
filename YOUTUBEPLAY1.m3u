Dr. Dain Heer is a globally recognized author, speaker, and change facilitator. He is renowned for his work in consciousness, encouraging people from all walks of life and cultures to embrace their true potential. He is the co-creator of Access Consciousness‚Ñ¢ and the founder of International Being You Day.

Originally trained as a chiropractor, Dr. Heer has a unique approach to healing. He facilitates people to recognize and follow their own abilities and knowledge. He encourages them to break free from the limitations and beliefs that prevent them from living their best lives.

Dr. Heer is the author of nine books on various topics, including embodiment, healing, money, and relationships. His book, Being You, Changing the World, has been an international bestseller. He has been a guest on hundreds of nationally syndicated radio and TV shows, including Fox News and Gaiam TV. He also hosts his own radio show called Conversations in Consciousness.

Growing up in the ghettos of Los Angeles, Dr. Heer struggled with depression and anxiety. At age 15, he discovered meditation and alternative healing, which led him to study chiropractic. However, he soon realized that he was not satisfied with the traditional approach to healing. He began exploring a different way of facilitating change and transformation.

Dr. Heer's work in consciousness has led him to co-create Access Consciousness‚Ñ¢ with Gary Douglas. Access Consciousness‚Ñ¢ is a set of tools and techniques designed to help people access their own knowledge and consciousness. It has become a global movement changing how people approach healing, relationships, and money.

In addition to his work with Access Consciousness‚Ñ¢, Dr. Heer has created several programs and events that encourage people to explore their potential. One of these events is International Being You Day, which celebrates every individual's unique gifts and talents. Dr. Heer believes that everyone has something valuable to contribute to the world, and he encourages people to embrace their true greatness.
